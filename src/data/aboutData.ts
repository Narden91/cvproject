  summary: [
    "I am a PhD student focused on developing AI-driven medical diagnostic tools through machine learning and artificial intelligence applications. I analyze multiple data sources - handwriting dynamics, neuroimaging, and biological markers - to create early detection methods for Neurodegenerative Diseases (ND) and Specific Learning Disorders (SLD).",
    "My research utilizes deep learning architectures, specifically Transformers and CNNs, to build diagnostic frameworks that show promising results in the early detection of conditions like Alzheimer's disease using offline handwriting images. I implement explainability tools such as SHAP values and attention visualization to ensure that AI-driven diagnoses provide clear insights for healthcare practitioners."
